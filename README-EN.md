- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kintong3000.me.git
    cd kintong3000.me
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**
    This command starts a hot-reloading development server, usually available at `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  **Build the project**
    This command builds the entire website into static files, outputting them to the `dist/` directory.
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

5.  **Preview the build locally**
    This command starts a local server to preview the static files from the `dist/` directory.
    ```bash
    pnpm preview
    ```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Deployment

The core of this project is the combination of a **Static Site Generation (SSG)** architecture and the automated deployment pipeline (CI/CD) from platforms like **Vercel**.

This allows developers to focus solely on creating content, while the build and deployment processes are handled automatically.

### Static Site Generation (SSG) Workflow

When the `pnpm build` command is executed, the project converts the source code and Markdown content into a complete, purely static website. The process is as follows:

1.  **Content Scanning**: The `unplugin-vue-router` plugin scans the structure of the `pages/` directory and automatically generates the corresponding website routes.
2.  **Content Transformation**: The `unplugin-vue-markdown` plugin reads all `.md` files and converts their content into Vue components.
3.  **Page Pre-rendering**: The `vite-ssg` tool simulates a visit to every page of the site, executes the corresponding Vue components, and captures the final rendered output as plain HTML files.
4.  **Artifact Output**: All generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are placed in the `dist/` directory, which contains the entire deployable website.

### Vercel's Automated Deployment Flow

Once the project is linked to Vercel, every `git push` triggers an automated deployment:

1.  **Local Commit**: You modify code or update an article in the `pages/` directory and push the changes to your GitHub repository using `git push`.
2.  **Trigger Deployment**: GitHub notifies Vercel of the update via a webhook.
3.  **Cloud Build**: Vercel pulls the latest code and automatically runs the `pnpm build` command, completing the SSG process in the cloud.
4.  **Atomic Deployment**: After a successful build, Vercel deploys the `dist/` directory to its global CDN and instantly points your domain to the new version. This process is seamless and ensures no downtime.
